===========  OYG modal  ============
8      T_f_OYG  - Time constant
===========  IAG modal  ============
0.3    A1   - Constant in the expression of phi_alpha^c and phi_q^c.  This value is relatively insensitive for thin airfoils, but may be different for turbine airfoils. [from experimental results, defaults to 0.3]
0.7    A2   - Constant in the expression of phi_alpha^c and phi_q^c.  This value is relatively insensitive for thin airfoils, but may be different for turbine airfoils. [from experimental results, defaults to 0.7]
0.7    b1   - Constant in the expression of phi_alpha^c and phi_q^c.  This value is relatively insensitive for thin airfoils, but may be different for turbine airfoils. [from experimental results, defaults to 0.7]
0.53   b2   - Constant in the expression of phi_alpha^c and phi_q^c.  This value is relatively insensitive for thin airfoils, but may be different for turbine airfoils. [from experimental results, defaults to 0.53]
0.75   ka    -
1.7    T_p  - Boundary-layer,leading edge pressure gradient time constant in the expression of Dp. It should be tuned based on airfoil experimental data. [default = 1.7]
3      T_f  - Initial value of the time constant associated with Df in the expression of Df and f''. [default = 3]
6      T_V  - Initial value of the time constant associated with the vortex lift decay process; it is used in the expression of Cvn. It depends on Re,M, and airfoil class. [default = 6]
11     T_VL - Initial value of the time constant associated with the vortex advection process; it represents the non-dimensional time in semi-chords, needed for a vortex to travel from LE to trailing edge (TE); it is used in the expression of Cvn. It depends on Re, M (weakly), and airfoil. [valid range = 6 - 13, default = 6]
